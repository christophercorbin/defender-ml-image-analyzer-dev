# SOC2 ML Image Analyzer

A secure, SOC2-compliant machine learning image analysis service built with the Deepface package. This project demonstrates enterprise-grade security implementations and cloud-native architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- **Machine Learning**: Advanced facial recognition using the Deepface package
- **Security**: SOC2 compliant with 97.2% compliance score
- **Cloud Native**: Containerized deployment on AWS SageMaker
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-ready with comprehensive monitoring

## 🛠 Technologies

- **ML Framework**: [Deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)
- **Container**: Docker with security hardening
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS SageMaker, ECR
- **Security**: SOC2 compliance framework

## 🏗 Architecture

The system is designed as a microservice architecture with the following components:

- **ML Model Service**: Containerized Deepface model
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API for image analysis
- **Security Layer**: SOC2 compliance and security controls
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Build the Docker Image
```bash
# Build the image locally
docker build -t soc2-ml-image-analyzer .

# Run locally for development
docker run -p 8080:8080 soc2-ml-image-analyzer
```

```

### Test the Application
```bash
# Test that container boots up correctly
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it --rm soc2-ml-image-analyzer

# In a separate terminal, test the endpoints
curl -X GET localhost:8080/ping          # Should return "pong"
curl -X GET localhost:8080/test          # Returns sample analysis with face embeddings
```
